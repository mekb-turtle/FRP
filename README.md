## FRP
A simple extension forcing Reddit videos to be played by the fallback player.

### Installation:
FRP is only available to Firefox at this moment. I will consider making a chrome version in the future, but not now yet.
**Instruction:**
1. Download the zip file in the "Releases" tab.
2. Open up Firefox, navigate to `about:addons`, click on "Extensions", click on the cog icon and select "Install Add-on from file".
3. Select the `.zip` file you just downloaded.
4. It should work now. If it doesn't, please open an issue.
*#NOTE: Sometimes Reddit's player will override the fallback player again, in that case refreshing should work.*
